# Booking Api

**Link to the API**: 
http://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-GetBookings 


Some requirements:
* ”createBooking” and “getBookingById” endpoints are working;
* “partialUpdateBooking , “deleteBooking” and “getBookingIds” should be covered with all possible tests;
* meet standard requirements for Unit tests.


How to use:
```mvn clean test``` to clean and then run tests.


**Note**: should use current API behaviour as specified (thus some checks are failed).
